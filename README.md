### 1.2 Features

The ATK-MD0700 module is a high-performance 7.0-inch TFT LCD capacitive touchscreen module launched by ALIENTEK. The module has an LCD resolution of 480*800 pixels, supports 16-bit true color display, and uses SSD1963 as the LCD driver chip. This chip comes with its own RAM, eliminating the need for additional drivers or memory. As a result, most external controllers can easily drive the module.  At the same time, the ATK-MD0700 module also supports touch, using a capacitive touch screen that supports 5-point simultaneous touch, providing excellent control effects.
